# AI Experiments

This repository contains my personal experiments with artificial intelligence libraries and tools.
In the following, you find some example applications, which I have developed during my AI learning journey.
It is amazing to see, how easy AI can be integrated into software applications nowadays.

## Examples

Here is an overview of the examples contained in this repository.

### üßë‚Äçüíª [Text Generation](./Sources/text-generation.py)

This first example demonstrates the use of LLaMa 3.2 for providing a ChatGPT-like experience on your local computer in the command line.

### üßë‚Äçüíª [Image Generation](./Sources/image-generation.py)

This second example demonstrates the use of Stable Diffusion 1.5 for generating images from text prompts on your local computer in the command line.

The above prompt generated the following image.
Note that with other pretrained diffusion models and prompts better results probably can be achieved.

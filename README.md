# AI Experiments

This repository contains my personal experiments with artificial intelligence libraries and tools.
In the following, you find some example applications, which I have developed during my AI learning journey.
It is amazing to see, how easy AI can be integrated into software applications nowadays.

## üßë‚Äçüíª [LLaMa Text Generation](./Sources/llama-text-generation.py)

This first example demonstrates the use of LLaMa for providing a ChatGPT-like experience on your local computer in the command line.
The example uses the `transformers` Python library, which is provided by [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index).

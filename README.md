# AI Experiments

This repository contains my personal experiments with artificial intelligence libraries and tools.
In the following, you find some example applications, which I have developed during my AI learning journey.
It is amazing to see, how easy AI can be integrated into software applications nowadays.

## Examples

Here is an overview of the examples contained in this repository.

### üßë‚Äçüíª [LLaMa Text Generation](./Sources/llama-text-generation.py)

This first example demonstrates the use of LLaMa for providing a ChatGPT-like experience on your local computer in the command line.
